# Alexa-interviewer
Enabling Alexa to mock up interviews of your choice.
The Alexa skill fetches interview questions for specific companies from Glassdoor. These are user-submitted questions from actual people who had an interview at the same company, who chose to post their questions online. The user-submitted questions are stored in a DynamoDB. The application is written in Python with Flask-ask, Zappa.
